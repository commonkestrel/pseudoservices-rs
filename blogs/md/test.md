This is some test blog content.
I'm just using it to test sizing, coloring, etc...

## How are they made?

The articles are typed in Markdown, then rendered and
placed into a template I use for every blog.

It can turn something like this:
```md
#### Wow, look at me!

That's pretty cool.
```
Into this:

#### Wow, look at me!

That's pretty cool.

### Let's test some things!

How about code blocks?
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello world!");
}
```

#### What about bullets?
- single
- double
- triple?

#### Maybe tables
| h | e | a | d |
|---|---|---|---|
| wow | so cool | amazing | wonderful |

#### Wait, do math expressions work?

$$
\int x^x dx = x^x\ln(ex) + C
$$

They also work inline: \\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\)

#### How about HTML?
